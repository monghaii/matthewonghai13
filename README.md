### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Matthew Onghai ðŸ¤©

I'm a web, machine learning and video game software engineer based in Austin, Texas.

I'm very passionate about expressing creativity in my pursuits and making things that people haven't seen before. As a result, I have many overlapping interests across the tech stack. I'm excited to see what we can work on together!

Outside of programming, I'm very interested in making music, painting, photography, astronomy, and graphic design.
